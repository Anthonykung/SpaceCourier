## Seller

Seller can be anything from restaurants to stores. Seller can set either to let teh customers choose how to pay the courier or sellect how the courier get paid. When the customer placed an order, seller prepare the order and posts a request for courier services. Seller can select whether to pay the courier themselves by setting a fixed price or a percentage of the order (hourly is not an option due to potential abuse) or let the customer pay for the courier service and choose between fixed price or percentage. The courier accept the request and make the delivery.

## Customers

Customers can browse seller listings such as food item or product and select them, the customer may have to pay for the courier service depending on the seller's settings. In case of unregistered seller or special requests such as business deliveries, customer can post request for courier services and will show as special requests. Courier will see the special requests with a short description provided by the customer and choose either to accept or reject, requests will not be cancelled if one courier rejects it, other couriers will still be able to see the requests and decide whether to accept or not. Courier can see the detailed description if they choose to learn more. For example, a customer could post a special request for buying a very cool sticker in a sticker shop that is not registered on the network, courier will see in the short description that they will have to shop for the product in store rather than just picking it up. Another example of special requests will be a business needing an important package delivered to another business, courier will see that they are required to deliver a package and simply make the delivery.

## Courier

Courier make deliveries for the customers, it can range from anything from normal delivery or special requests. Courier will be able to see the requests that is near by, actual earning will be hidden until after the request is completed to prevent courier developing a bias against lower paying sellers or customers. However, to prevent abuse from the seller and customer, a minimium will be automatically determined by the system on the distance, demand, region, and estimated time. Courier will be able to accept or ignore requests and will receive the payment after the request is mark as completed by the courier and the geolocation detail matches the designation as well as within a set time limit. The time limit is calculated from the distance, the traffic condition and a padded time appropriate to the requests. For special requests, the time limit is only applicable for the delivery process. This is to prevent courier mark uncompleted requests as completed.
